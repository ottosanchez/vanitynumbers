  > This application provides vanity number options for your phone number. In order to get vanity numbers for your phone number, you need to dial the provided service phone number (provided directly to the application user upon request). If vanity numbers are found, they will be read out to you by an automated menu and recorded in a webpage for your reference (https://master.d1w8okf54d17xb.amplifyapp.com/). Only the last 5 users (identified by phone number) for which at least a vanity number was found will be available in the webpage.

  The application considers the last 7 digits of your phone number when coming up with vanity numbers.
